Q1: Crack MD5 hash code

According to the string in first question provided which is '482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38' ï¼Œthis hash matches the characteristics of an MD5 hash (32-character hexadecimal string). 

In order to crack this hash, the tool **hashcat** is commonly used.  

Step 1: Save the hash into a file:

```bash
echo "482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38" > hash.txt
```

Step 2: Run hashcat with the rockyou.txt wordlist (commonly used for weak password cracking):

```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

'-m 0' specifies MD5

'-a 0' specifies dictionary attack

rockyou.txt refers to a weak password list

Hash successfully cracked by hashcat, the password is 'password123'
